## Day 9 Final Project - 100 Days of Python 

### Blind Auction

This program will allow multiple users to carry out a blind auction in which the highest bid will be disclosed at the end. It will also recognize any ties and ask the users to run the program again. The program contains minimal validation to stay in line with the 100 days to code Python course.
